  	A bit about me is that I like crafts and I am getting into programming. I currently attend American River College in Sacramento, California in a major in Computer science. I am a first year going on to my second in Fall 2015. I would like to transfer to Cal Poly San Luis Opispo in a major in Computer Science and a minor in Environmental Science(if I can squeeze it in). I also am interested in UC Berkeley but that is quite a strech.
